        <h1 class="text-center">Why PHP and MySQL</h1>
        <p>The programming languages used in the implementation of this project are PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and MYSQL programming languages. PHP is a general purpose server side scripting language originally designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. It has also evolved to include a command line interface capability and can be used in stand-alone graphical applications.
	The following features make PHP a preferred implementation language for this project:
i.	PHP has its root in C and C++. PHP syntax is most similar to C and C++ language syntax, so programmers find it easy to learn and manipulate.
ii.	PHP can run on both UNIX and windows. Hence it is compatible across various operating systems.
iii.	PHP has powerful output buffering that further increases over the output flow.  PHP internally rearranges the buffer so that the header comes before the content.
</p>
        <p>MYSQL is a relational database management system written in C and C++, that runs as a server providing multi user access to a number of databases. MYSQL is used basically to create a relational database structure on a server in order to store data or automate procedures. The following features make MYSQL also a preferred implementation language in this research:

i.	MYSQL is written in C and C++ and tested with a broad range of different compilers. It also functions on different platforms.
ii.	It uses multi-layered server design with independent modules.
iii.	It is designed to be fully multi-threaded using kernel threads to easily use multiple CPUs if they are available.
